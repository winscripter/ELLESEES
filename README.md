# ELLESEES
This is a video editor project I've wrote. Called it "ELLESEES" (Edit Less - Less Editing; See Everything - Everyone Sees). Yeah, if you call it stupid, I agree. I wasn't
familiar with video editing at the time and just assumed this one is powerful. However, it can edit videos in some ways, like contrast, advanced text tool, and other.
Abandoned it the same day as the release :D

Since then, I just migrated to Clipchamp. Microsoft did a good job on that one. :D

Literally, please don't use this video editor to edit real-world videos. It's only made as a learning tool. Doesn't even support playback.
Digging through the source code, you'll find many things like "this is not yet implemented, but it will be implemented soon" (soon - never).
Stick to other video editors, like VEGAS Pro, Adobe Premiere Pro, or Adobe After Effects. Free video editors include DaVinci Resolve, Clipchamp, and more.
